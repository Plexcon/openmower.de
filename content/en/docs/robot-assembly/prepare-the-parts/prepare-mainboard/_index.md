{{% alert title="Info" color="info" %}}
If you have bought the hardware kit, the mainboard already has firmware installed, but it's a good idea to [update it to
latest version](/docs/knowledge-base/firmware-update) anyway.

If you have just soldered the mainboard yourself, you will need to upload firmware once via USB. This is, because
without the firmware, the main Raspberry Pi won't turn on.

For this, follow the [Manual Firmware Installation](/docs/knowledge-base/manual-firmware-installation/) guide.
